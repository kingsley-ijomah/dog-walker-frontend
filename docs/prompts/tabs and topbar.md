Add a new path called tabs that loads both component and children from ./tabs/tabs.component and ./tabs/tabs.routes

#### Step 5
update @tabs.component.html Update this so it becomes a footer tab containing the following links. Home, groups, walks, chats. dont use routerLink we will rely on just the tab naming, also update the tabs component to include all necessary imports
