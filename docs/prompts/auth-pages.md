Generate an Ionic Angular form using ReactiveFormsModule with fields for Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, Telephone, and a checkbox for Accept Terms and Conditions. Each field should have a placeholder but no visible labels. The form should be generated in the /auth/pages/signup directory.

The input fields should be chunky with rounded edges, a thin border, and a clean design. All fields should be required, with validation messages displayed below each field when invalid. Email must be in a valid format, the password must be at least 6 characters, Confirm Password should match Password, and the Terms and Conditions checkbox must be checked before submission.

The submit button should be disabled until all fields are correctly filled. On successful form submission, display an Ionic Toast message confirming the submission. Style the input fields to be chunky with rounded edges and thin borders, while the submit button should also be chunky, pill-shaped, and rounded.

Use ReactiveFormsModule and FormBuilder for the form setup. The submit method should be included in the TypeScript file but left empty for now. Generate the complete HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript code for this form, ensuring it matches the described design and validation requirements, and ensure the form is properly structured in the /auth/pages/signup directory, and app routes updated accordingly

Stick to using theme variables
