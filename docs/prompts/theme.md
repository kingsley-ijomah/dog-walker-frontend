Generate a low-fidelity theming system for an Ionic Angular project using SCSS variables. The theme should be grayscale but avoid any variable names containing the word "gray." Instead, use creative, neutral names that describe the tone or feel of the colour, making it easy to adjust in the future.

Define SCSS variables with a range of at least six shades per colour, from lightest to darkest, ensuring each colour family has multiple shades for flexibility. Each shade should increment in darkness for consistent visual hierarchy.

Provide example usage for Ionic components, including:

Buttons: Primary, secondary, and hover states using the shades.
Backgrounds: Light, medium, and dark backgrounds.
Text: Standard text, headings, and disabled states using various shades.
Ensure the design system remains minimal, flexible, and scalable for future colour adjustments.

Example SCSS variable names:

$mist-100 for the lightest shade.
$stone-400 for a medium tone.
$charcoal-900 for the darkest shade.

Generate the SCSS code with a full colour palette, including the usage examples applied to Ionic components like buttons and cards.
